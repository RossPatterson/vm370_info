Description of change:
 
This update changes the way that CMS calls BREXX for
EXEC files identified as REXX programs. The old method
copied and modied the argument list and then issued
SVC 202 to routine DMSREX. This method does a direct
branch into BREXX and does not modify the plists
(except for one case). When an EXEC is called using
IMPEX (IMPlied EXec), the extended plist in CMS has the
command name field set to the EXEC program name, not
the word 'EXEC'. The EXPLIST set changed in this case
to make the program name the first argument and EXEC
the command name.
 
The update also resets the Halt Interpretation (HI),
Trace Start (TS), and Trace End (TE) settings when
the control is passed to the READY prompt.
