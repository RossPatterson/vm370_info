Support for a 'LEAVE' option to the CLASS B CP DETACH Command
 
NEW COMMAND SYNTAX (Class B) :
CP DETACH [CUU] <FROM> [USERID] <LEAVE>
NEW ERROR MESSAGE :
DMKVDD003E INVALID OPTION : XXX
 
Affected Modules :
 
DMKVDC ASSEMBLE
DMKVDD ASSEMBLE
DMKVDR ASSEMBLE
VBLOKS COPY
 
Description :
When DMKVDD invokes DMKVDCSN, DMKVDCSN will check for a 'LEAVE' option on the
Class B Variant of the detach command. If it is present, a VDD bit is set to
indicate the option was specified.
DMKVDD will then invoke DMKVDREL for each affected VDEV. If the LEAVE option
was specified and the VDEV is a tape, then a bit is set in the VDEVBLOK to
request VDREL not to issue a RUN CCW on the real tape. VDREL will just skip
the issuing of the RUN CCW when the bit is set.
