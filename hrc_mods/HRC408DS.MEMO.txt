LOCAL MODIFICATION HRC408DS
 
This update supports calling REXX external functions with
a call type X'05' plist. When an EXEC is called with this
plist, control is always passed to REXX, since the original
EXEC processor does not support this call type. The eplist
is not updated in any way but is passed to the REXX
processor unmodified.
