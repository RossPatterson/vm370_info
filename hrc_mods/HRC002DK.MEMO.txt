LOCAL MODIFICATION HRC002DK - WAS ISW00001
 
Support for a 'POWEROFF' option to the CP SHUTDOWN command
 
Affected Modules :
 
DMKCPR ASSEMBLE
DMKCKP ASSEMBLE
PSA MACRO
 
Description :
When the SHUTDOWN Command is invoked, DMKCPR will now check for an additional
POWEROFF option. If this is the case, a bit is set in PSA to indicate
that DMKCKP should attempt a system POWER OFF upon shutdown.
DMKCPR then invokes the RESTART procedure, re-entering DMKCKP
DMKCKP Will then check for the bit set in the PSA. If the bit is set,
then the NEW Program PSW is set to the wait state (in case the ensuing DIAG
fails with a program interrupt and invokes DIAG 1F with Registers R1 and R2
Set to the word POWEROFF. The POWER OFF request bit in PSA is reset.
If the hardware is capable of doing a POWER OFF by itself, this will be done.
If the hardware does not recognize diag 1F, then a program check will occur
(most possibly a SPECIFICATION EXCEPTION).. in which case, the Shutdown
wait state will be loaded via the program new PSW.
If the POWEROFF request bit is not set in PSA, then no power off is
attempted.
