LOCAL MODIFICATION HRC411DS
 
This update implements support for an EXECIO command for VM/370.
It implements an EXECIO command as described in:
 
http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/370/VM_SP/Release_5_Dec86/SC19-6209-4_VM_SP_CMS
_Command_Reference_Release_5_Dec86.pdf
 
The EXECIO command documented in that manual is the specification for
this implementation. This EXECIO implementation contains no code from
any IBM version. Using this command with BREXX requires that all CMS updates
from the 'CMS Extensions for BREXX' folder in the FILES area of
 
h390-vm@groups.io
 
are applied to your VM/370 system, and that BREXX
updates (already or soon to be) loaded on the FILES area are
also running on your system. For example, the latest BREXX
changes implement the EXECCOMM subcommand facility so that EXECIO
can fetch or assign REXX variables.
