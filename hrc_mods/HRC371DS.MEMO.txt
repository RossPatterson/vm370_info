LOCAL MODIFICATION HRC371DS
 
This modification integrates Regina REXX into CMS as an alternate EXEC
interpreter.  This adds 440K of code (!) to CMS high storage.  You can
remove these from memory (and disable implicit execution of REXX
programs) by issuing these commands:
   RESLIB DELETE DMSREX
   RESLIB DELETE GCCLIB
 
The changes include:
 
1. Loader Tables allocation
 
Change CMS initialization so that if the virtual machine size is 4MB
or larger, 64 pages are allocated for the loader tables instead of
only 3 pages.
 
 
2. SYSPROF EXEC
 
Change CMS initialization processing to execute SYSPROF EXEC (if it
exists) before executing PROFILE EXEC A (if it exists).  If either
"ACCESS ( NOPROF" or "ACCESS NODISK" were entered as the first command
after the IPL command, then neither SYSPROF EXEC or PROFILE EXEC are
executed.  Eventually we may want to first release the A disk, to
ensure that SYSPROF EXEC S is executed, and not one on the A disk.
 
 
3. Implicit invocatation of a REXX interpreter
 
The RESLIB command is used to load Regina REXX and the GCC runtime
library (on which it depends) into high memory.
 
If an EXEC is a REXX program (i.e. it begins with "/*") then the DMSREX
command is invoked to interpret it.
 
3. CMSLEVEL message
 
The CMSLEVEL message is updated to relflect that this is the "SixPack".
