LOCAL MODIFICATION HRC400DS
 
This update implements setting the Halt Immediate,
Trace Start and Trace End bits in NUCON when the
HI, TS, and TE immediate commands are issued. The bits are
interogated by the BREXX interpretor when it starts and at
REXX statement boundaries.
 
The syntax and usage description of these commands can
be found in any set of VM manuals starting with VM/SP.
 
Affected Macros/Copy files :
 
NUCON    - Add the EXECHALT and EXECTRAC bit
           definitions in the EXECSTAT byte
 
Affected Modules : (FT ASSEMBLE)
 
DMSCIT     Adds the new immediate commands to the
           CMS console device handler
 
DMSNUC     Forces re-assembly to pick up changes
           in the NUCON MACRO file.
 
Description of change:
 
Tests for the new immediate commands are added to DMSCIT. They
set bits in Page 0 which are tested by the REXX interpretor.
