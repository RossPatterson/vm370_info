LOCAL MODIFICATION HRC106DS
 
Accept FORM=E on FS macros for greater VM/SP compatibility
 
Description:
 
This update enhances the following macros to accept FORM=E as an argument as may
be encountered when building software designed for versions of VM later than
VM/370 release 6. This avoids assembly failures when assembling source which
makes use of FORM=E. No additional functionality is included, when FORM=E is
specified except that an MNOTE warning is issued to indicate that a macro with
a FORM=E argument was encountered.
 
Files affected:
 
FSCB    MACRO
FSOPEN  MACRO
FSPOINT MACRO
FSSTATE MACRO
FSREAD  MACRO
FSWRITE MACRO
 
Installation:
 
Rebuild CMSLIB MACLIB.
 
No reassembly is required nor is it necessary to regenerate any modules.
