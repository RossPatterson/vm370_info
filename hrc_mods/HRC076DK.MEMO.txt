LOCAL MODIFICATION HRC076DK
 
Support the SHUTDOWN REIPL command
 
 
DMKCKP   ASSEMBLE
 
Description :
Some support for SHUTDOWN REIPL was introduced by whomever wrote
HRC002DK, but the support was never completed (the REIPL bit was set
but no action was taken).  This modification completes the process.
A true IPL simulation is performed.  After the shutdown warm start
data is saved, the actual IPL record is loaded from the original IPL
device, and then the IPL PSW is loaded and execution begins with
the actual CP IPL sequence to restart the system.
 
If any errors are encountered while trying to load the IPL record,
the system will instead halt with a disabled wait code 8, which
represents the last good status:  warm start data saved.
