LOCAL MODIFICATION HRC105DS
 
Extend FSTD / STATEFST for greater VM/SP compatibility
 
Affected files:
 
FSTD   MACRO  (CMSLIB MACLIB)
FVS    MACRO  (CMSLIB MACLIB)
 
Description:
 
FSTD DSECT which is defined in FSTD MACRO defines the API for several file
system calls including FSSTATE for example.
 
This update extends FSTD to include the following fields:
 
FSTADBC  - Alternate block count (fullword copy of halfword FSTDBC)
FSTAIC   - Alternate item count (fullword copy of halfword FSTIC)
FSTADATI - Alternate date and time (6 bytes - x'yymmddhhmmss')
 
These fields can then be referenced when building software designed for
versions of VM later than VM/370 Release 6 and the task of backporting such
software is eased.
 
While FSTADBC and FSTAIC are fullword quantities, their values are still
restricted to those of halfword quantities because the FST table entries on
800 byte block disks do not have any room to include the larger quantities.
 
FSTADATI is an alternate format of the last written date and time in packed BCD.
It is mostly built from pre-existing fields FSTYEARW and FSTDATEW, however, no
value for the time in seconds is available in the 800 byte block FST so it is
to an arbitrary constant value of 29.
 
Internally to CMS, much use is made of STATEFST whose layout is defined by
FVSECT DSECT in FVS MACRO. STATEFST is populated whenever a STATE or STATEW
command or function is executed.
 
FSTD DSECT must correspond with the first part of FVSECT but if FSTD is extended
with new fields added at the end (as happens in this update and in later
versions of CMS), the same fields must also be added to the middle of FVSECT
because FVSECT is larger that FSTD. This causes the location of the last two
fields in FVSECT to move.
 
While this update also makes the required changes to FVSECT / STATEFST, a number
of CMS components, including critically UPDATE (used by VMFASM and VMFMAC),
reference the last two fields in STATEFST and must be rebuilt to take account of
their movement.
 
Any other software which makes use of these fields in FVSECT / STATEFST must
also be rebuilt. If hardcoded constants (typically 40 and 44) are used instead
of the symbolic offsets FVSFSTAD (alias STATER0) and FVSFSTAC (alias STATER1),
these must also be fixed before rebuilding. Note however that software that
assumes the on disk size of the FST on an 800 byte block disk to be 40 bytes
will not require modification or rebuild.
 
Prerequisites:
 
HRC015DS must be installed before installing this update.
 
Installation:
 
CMSLIB MACLIB must be rebuilt.  The following modules must be reassembled:
 
DMSABN
DMSALU
DMSBRD
DMSCMP
DMSDSK
DMSERS
DMSFNS
DMSINT
DMSLBM
DMSMOD
DMSNUC
DMSPUN
DMSRNM
DMSSOP
DMSSTT
DMSUPD
VMFDATE
 
This can be done using ASM105DS EXEC. It is particularly important to ensure
DMSLBM, DMSUPD and VMFDATE are all reassembled before ipling the newly generated
nucleus because there will be difficulties using VMFMAC and/or VMFASM to do this
after the new nucleus is brought into use and it will be difficult or impossible
to generate new MACLIB, UPDATE and VMFDATE modules if the correct object files
are not already available.
 
The following modules must then be rebuilt using CMSGEND:
 
COMPARE
DISK
MACLIB
PUNCH
RENAME
UPDATE
VMFDATE
 
The CMS nucleus should then be rebuilt.
