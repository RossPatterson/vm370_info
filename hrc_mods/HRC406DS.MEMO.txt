This update implements support for the CMS multilevel stack
facility with the commands: MAKEBUF, DROPBUF, and SENTRIES.
These commands enable REXX programs to partition off a segment
of CMS stack space for their own use. The stack space segemnt
can be easily removed during REXX program termination so
that the stacked information belonging to a caller was
restored the the state expected by that caller. This cleanup
facilitated successful error recovery for REXX programs.
 
The syntax and usage description of these commands can
be found in any set of VM manuals starting with VM/SP.
 
Affected Macros/Copy files :
 
NUCON    HRC406DS  - Adds control block anchors for the
                     current state of the program stack
 
Affected Modules : (FT ASSEMBLE)
 
DMSBUF   HRC406DS - dummy update to add new assemble file
 
DMSCAT   HRC406DS - changes the ATTN function to use the multi-level
                    stack control block structure when stacking lines.
                    ATTN is used by REXX queue and push operations.
 
DMSCIT   HRC406DS - changes the virtual console interrupt processor to
                    use the new stack control block structure to stack
                    incoming data from the console. Modifies the DESBUF
                    command to issue a DROPBUF 0 to clear out all
                    stacked messages.
 
DMSCRD   HRC406DS - satisfy a console read with stacked data from the
                    new stack control block structure
 
DMSEXT   HRC406DS - supply the count of stacked lines to the &READFLAG
                    variable in the original EXEC language processor
 
DMSFNC   HRC406DS - Adds the MAKEBUF, DROPBUF, and SENTRIES
                    commands to the table of in memory commands
 
DMSNUC   HRC406DS - Forces re-assembly to pick up changes in the NUCON MACRO fil
                    NUCON MACRO file
 
New assembler source:
 
DMSBUF   ASSEMBLE  - implements the MAKEBUF, DROPBUF, and SENTRIES commands
 
Description of change:
 
This update implements the infrastructure to support the MAKEBUF,
DROPBUF, and SENTRIES command used by REXX. Changes to implement
the restructured stack are made in the ATTN function, and to
the console I/O handler.
 
To build the classic EXEC processor MODULE file:
 
   EXEC CMSGEND DMSEXT
 
The CMSLOAD EXEC fileis updated. This file names all the parts to be
included in the CMS Nucleus. EDIT the CMSLOAD EXEC file and
insert lines to include new file DMSBUF TEXT.
*
   A line is inserted for new routine DMSBUF just after
   the existing line naming DMSTIO. That part of the
   CMSLOAD EXEC file will now look like this:
 
&1 &2 &3 DMSZNR
&1 &2 &3 DMSTIO
&1 &2 &3 DMSBUF   <------ Add this line here
&1 &2 &3 DMSCSF
&1 &2 &3 DMSZIT
