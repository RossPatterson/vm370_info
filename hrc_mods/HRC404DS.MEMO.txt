LOCAL MODIFICATION HRC400DS
 
This update implements support for Nucleus Extensions
and Subcommand processing.
 
Affected Macros/Copy files :
 
NUCEXT     (New) A compatible implementation of the IBM NUCEXT MACRO
 
SUBCOM     (New) A compatible implementation of the IBM SUBCOM MACRO
 
SCBLOCK    (New) A compatible implementation of the IBM SCBLOCK MACRO
 
SHVBLOCK   (New) A compatible implementation of the IBM SHVBLOVK MACRO
 
NUCON      Add control block anchors, counters, and address
           constants for communications between the support code
           elements for NUCEXTs and SUBCOMs
 
Affected Modules : (FT ASSEMBLE)
 
DMSABN     Accounts for any NUCLEUS storage left allocated by a
           Nucleus Extension after an ABEND
 
DMSFNC     Adds the NUCEXT and SUBCOM entry point names and addresses
           called by the NUCEXT and SUBCOM MACRO expansions
 
DMSINS     Establishes a 'CMS' subcommand environment during CMS
           system initialization. Calling the subcommand locates a
           desired VM command using the same search rules as if the
           command had been issued at the "Ready;" prompt.
 
DMSINT     Deletes any subcommand which was NOT established with the
           SYSTEM=YES operand, before returning to the "Ready;" prompt.
           Removes code for building the EPLIST, as that is now done by
           the ASCANN routine. Reference the system UPPERCASE translate
           table address using field NUCUPPER rather than hard coding
           the DMSCRDUP address constant.
 
DMSITS     Supports using 'DC AL4(1)' in place of 'DC AL4(*+4)' after an
           SVC 202. This is compatible with later CMS versions, and removes
           an obstacle to making relocatable, adcon free code.
 
           Adds support to look for established Nucleus Extensions before
           looking for any other type of command for calltypes X'00' and X'01'.
 
           Adds support for the following calltype for SVC202:
                X'02' - The call is made to a Subcommand entry point.
                X'03' - The call bypasses the search for a Nucleus Extension
                        when an Eplist is present.
                X'04' - The call bypasses the search for a Nucleus Extension
                        when no Eplist is present.
 
DMSNUC     Forces re-assembly to pick up changes in the NUCON MACRO file.
 
DMSSCN     Builds an EPLIST for an ASCANN call. This code was relocated here
           from DMSINT for use by additional routines. This design is compatible
           with later CMS versions.
 
DMSCSF     (New) Implements the CMS subcommand environment for REXX address CMS
DMSNXD     (New) Implements the NUCXDROP command
DMSNXM     (New) Implements the NUCXMAP command
DMSSNX     (New) Implements the Nucleus Extension and Subcommand processing
                 for the NUCEXT and SUBCOM assembler macros
 
Description of change:
 
This update implements support for certain Nucleus Extensions
and CMS Subcommands. A general NUCXLOAD command is NOT
included because VM/370 does not currently support
relocatable MODULEs. Self loading Nucleus Extentions are
fully supported. Such a program allocates memory and copies
part of itself into it. The copied portions contain no
address constants, and can be relocated in memory successfully.
Examples of such programs includes the tape utility, BLOCKTAP,
and programs with the structure of a REXX function package.
 
The primary requirement for this support is to extend the REXX
capabilities currently being added to BREXX on the Sixpack.
 
A CMS subcommand is added for use by REXX with address 'CMS'.
It uses command line name resolution to find commands using
the standard rules for implied EXEC and the system abbreviation
table.
 
Programs can add their own subcommand entry points and
REXX EXECs will call them with address 'SOMECMD'.
 
The generalized SUBCOM facility will be used to implement
an EXECCOMM subcommand in BREXX, and an EXECIO utility command.
 
 
The syntax and usage description of these commands and
macros are found in any set of VM manuals starting with VM/SP.
 
Use these steps to rebuild the command module files:

These are the changes for the CMSLOAD EXEC file. This file names all
all the parts to be included in the CMS Nucleus. EDIT the CMSLOAD EXEC
file and insert lines to include new files DMSSNX TEXT and DMSCSF TEXT.
 
   Insert a line for new routine DMSSNX just after
   the existing line naming DMSDBG. That part of the
   CMSLOAD EXEC file will now look like this:
 
&CONTROL OFF
&1 &2 &3 DMKLD00E LOADER
&1 &2 &3 DMSNUC
&1 &2 &3 DMSDBG
&1 &2 &3 DMSSNX   <------ Add this line here
&1 &2 &3 DMSZNR
*
   Insert a line for new routine DMSCSF just after
   the existing line naming DMSTIO. That part of the
   CMSLOAD EXEC file will now look like this:
 
&1 &2 &3 DMSZNR
&1 &2 &3 DMSTIO
&1 &2 &3 DMSCSF   <------ Add this line here
&1 &2 &3 DMSZIT
