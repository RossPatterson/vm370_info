LOCAL MODIFICATION HRC425DS
 
Changed to add the SET CMSTYPE and QUERY CMSTYPE commands for use by
REXX programs.
 
Affected files:
 
 
DMSSET   ASSEMBLE  Implements the SET CMSTYPE HT|RT command.
 
DMSQRY   ASSEMBLE  Implements the QUERY CMSTYPE command.
 
 
Description:
 
The QUERY and SET CMSTYPE commands are used in REXX programs in the same
way as the &STACK HT and &STACK RT statements are used in the original
EXEC language. They allow other commands to be issued with their console
output suppressed.
