Description :
Normally, VM/370 requires that the WARM, CKPT, and ERR areas of CP
are located on the IPL volume.  This makes having an alternate CP
nucleus difficult because another set of these areas must exist
on the alternate volume.  Further, when you IPL the alternate nucleus
all of your spool data is lost because those pointers are not in the
alternate warm start and checkpoint areas.
 
This support for an alternate CP nucleus provides for the specification
of a specific volume location for the WARM, CKPT, and ERR areas.  Only
a single copy of these areas is required, and they are no longer
required to be on the IPL volume.  When CP is IPLed from an alternate
location it will still use the WARM,CKPT, and ERR areas as specified
by DMKSYS rather than implicitly on the IPL volume.  As long as
all alternate CP nuclei use the same WARM, CKPT, and ERR locations
in DMKSYS, your spool data is retained across alternate nucleus IPLs.
 
In order to use this support, simply add a volume name to the SYSERR,
SYSWRM, and SYSCKP operands of the SYSRES macro in DMKSYS.  For example,
 
         SYSOWN VMTST1,VMTST2
         SYSRES SYSVOL=VMTST1,SYSRES=1C8,....
               SYSWRM=(045,5,VMTST2),
               SYSERR=(024,2,VMTST2),
               SYSCKP=(039,6,VMTST4)
 
If no volume is specified, it will default to the IPL volume named in
the SYSVOL operand.  This is an important distinction because IPLing
an alternate nucleus would then expect WARM,CKPT, and ERR to be on that
alternate volume.  A specific volume must be specified in order to
ensure that that specified area location and volume is always used.
 
There is no need that all of the WARM,CKPT, and ERR areas be on the
same volume; they can be spread around.  Additionally, they can be
on different device types other than that specified on the SYSTYPE=
operand of SYSRES.
 
After changing the SYSRES macro to specify a volume for SYSERR,SYSCKP,
and SYSWRM, reassemble DMKSYS and build a CP nucleus as usual. If you
intend to continue to use the existing areas on your current IPL volume,
then specify the IPL volume name in SYSERR,SYSCKP, and SYSWRM, so that
location will be fixed.  If you choose a different volume for these
areas that is presently active in the running system, you will need
to do a COLD start the first time you IPL.
 
Any volume(s) that you select to contain the WARM, CKPT, or ERR areas
as well as the alternate CP nucleus must be specified in the SYSOWN
macro list of volumes.  If you are adding new volumes to SYSOWN,
add them to the end, otherwise you will have to IPL cold on your
next start up.
 
Once the WARM,ERR, and CKPT areas are fixed on a specific volume as
specified in their macro operands, all that is required to build an
alternate nucleus is to modify the SYSVOL=, and SYSRES= operands to
specify a new volume and unit address of where to build the new
CP nucleus.  You may need to adjust the SYSNUC= parameter to different
cylinder numbers as well depending on your space availability.  To
reduce confusion and the opportunity for errors, it is recommended
that you place the nucleus cylinders in exactly the same places on
your alternate volumes.
 
PLEASE REMEMBER: to format the cylinders that will be used to contain
the alternate CP nucleus with the format/allocate program
(IPL FMT S), before building your nucleus.
 
================
 
If you are using the VM/370 Community Edition Version 1 Release 1.2
or later, then the system is already setup to support an alternate
Nucleus location. Skip to the section on USING DEFINITIONS FOR THE
VM/370 Community Edition.
 
If you are using a different release, use following instructions:

SETTING UP THE ALTERNATE NUCLEUS SUPPORT SIMPLE EXAMPLE.
 
After installing HRC075DK and rebuilding your nucleus and you are up
and running, you now wish to initiate using alternate nuclei.  Assume
your DMKSYS SYSRES macro currently looks like this:
 
         SYSOWN VMPK01,VMPK03,VMPK06,VMPK07
         SYSRES SYSVOL=VMPK01,SYSRES=141,SYSTYPE=3350,SYSNUC=(001,19),
               SYSWRM=(045,2),
               SYSERR=(024,2),
               SYSCKP=(039,2)
 
and you wish to create an alternate nucleus on unit 146, volume VMPK06.
This example will use the existing WARM,CKPT, and ERR areas already
defined and currently in use.
 
First, check your SYSOWN list and see if you need to add VMPK06.
Then, add your SYSVOL= name to the SYSWRM, SYSERR, and SYSCKP operands
to specify their existing volume:
 
               SYSWRM=(045,2,VMPK01),
               SYSERR=(024,2,VMPK01),
               SYSCKP=(039,2,VMPK01)
 
Reassemble DMKSYS and rebuild the CP nucleus and re-ipl.  You
can do a warm start because these areas were not physically moved.
 
Then, if you wish to create an alternate nucleus on VMPK06, perhaps
to be used as a 'rescue' nucleus, simply alter SYSRES parameters as
shown:
 
         SYSRES SYSVOL=VMPK06,SYSRES=146,SYSTYPE=3350,SYSNUC=(001,19),
 
You may or may not need to alter SYSNUC= depending on your space
availability on the target volume.  Do not change the SYSWRM, SYSERR,
or SYSCKP values.  Then reassemble and build a CP nucleus; it will be
written to volume VMPK06.
 
Afterwards, you can IPL from either 141 or 146 as shown in this example
as desired, and use a warm start and preserve your spool data.

USING DEFINITIONS FOR THE VM/370 Community Edition:
 
The VM/370 Community Edition has been updated to reserve the disk
space for an alternate Nucleus on volume VM50-3. The volume where
the WarM start, Checkpoint, and Error reporting cylinders are
located is already defined in DMKSYS ASSEMBLE:
 
         SYSOWN (VM50-1,TEMP),(VM50-2,PAGE),(VM50-3,TEMP),(VM50-4,PAGE)
         SYSRES SYSVOL=VM50-1,                                         X
               SYSRES=6A1,                                             X
               SYSTYPE=3350,                                           X
               SYSNUC=(530,19),                                        X
               SYSWRM=(551,2,VM50-1),                                  X
               SYSERR=(549,2,VM50-1),                                  X
               SYSCKP=(553,2,VM50-1)
 
Then, if you wish to create an alternate nucleus, use the pre-defined
area on volume VM50-3, by altering the parameters as shown:
 
         SYSRES SYSVOL=VM50-3,                                         X
               SYSRES=6A3,                                             X
               SYSTYPE=3350,                                           X
               SYSNUC=(530,19),                                        X
               SYSWRM=(551,2,VM50-1),                                  X
               SYSERR=(549,2,VM50-1),                                  X
               SYSCKP=(553,2,VM50-1)
 
Assemble DMKSYS, and then rebuild the CP system with VMFLOAD, and the
alternate Nucleus will be written on the VM50-3 volume.
