# Information about VM/370 in the modern era

A number of people are discovering VM/370 thanks to the system currently known
as _VM/370 Community Edition_, which is based on IBM's _VM/370 R6 PLC ?_ system.
I discovered it in 1978 as a computer operator at the New Jersey Educational
Computer Network (NJECN), where we ran VM/370 R6 PLC 12 with IBM's _System Extensions
Program Product_ (SEPP).  I then worked with various versions for 20 years, very
intensively.  Here is a collection of information that may be useful to me after
a 20 year break from VM, and maybe others.
